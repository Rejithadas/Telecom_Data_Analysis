## Overview
Wavecon is a prominent telecom provider in India that ventured into the 5G domain in May 2022, aligning with industry trends. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the launch, the management observed a decline in active users and revenue growth. To address these concerns, the business director initiated a comprehensive analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) during the pre and post-5G launch periods.

## Purpose
The objective is to provide a detailed comparison report of KPIs between the periods before and after the 5G launch. The insights derived from this analysis will empower the executive management to make informed decisions aimed at recovering the active user rate and enhancing various key metrics.
